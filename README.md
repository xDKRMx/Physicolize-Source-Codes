# Physicolize-Source-Codes
Physicolize is a physics simulation application developed by myself within the scope of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics). It is designed to support high school students, particularly in simulating fundamental mechanics topics including Newton's Laws at the high school level.
